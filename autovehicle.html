 <h1> Autonomous Vehicles - IT Technologies </h1>
 <p><strong>   Brett Russell S3634270   </strong></p>

    <h2> What does it do? </h2>

      <p> As discussed by the <i>Department of Infrastructure (n.d.)</i> “Automated vehicles are vehicles that are able to control one or more of the primary driving controls (such as steering, acceleration or braking) without the need for human input”. </p>

      <p> Connected vehicles on the other hand are vehicles that communicate with the driver, other road users, roadside infrastructure and other wireless services using information and communication technologies. </p>

<br>

      <p> There are six classification levels which have been developed by the Society of Automotive engineers (SAE).  These automation levels are based on human input and the amount required to operate the vehicle. Level 0 requires the driver to perform all driving tasks, and level 5 automation indicates that a vehicle is able to drive itself without any human involvement.  In Australia it is becoming common to see level 1 & level 2 automation, which means a vehicle can assist with driving, however the person still watched the road and keeps their hands on the steering wheel and intervenes when required.  Features such as adaptive cruise control, lane assistance and parking assistance are common with level 1 & 2 automation.  Level 3 vehicles are currently being tested in Australia and overseas but are not yet available commercially. To continue progressing, there is significant number of trials and tests to be carried out.  These trials and tests are essential to ensure all safety requirements are met, considering level 5 automation involves a vehicle driving itself all of the time under all conditions and requires no human input to drive or take action, this poses a serious risk to other road users.  Until the safety of other road users can be guaranteed, without incident it would be unsafe to introduce this level of automation full time on our roads. </p>

      <p><i>MIT Technologies (2019)</i> discusses that the primary benefit of automated vehicles is their increased safety.  With the main goal being to reduce the number of accidents, it is demonstrated that they are safer than cars that don’t have collision-avoidance technology today”.  There are however lingering challenges including safety, security, and managing public perception and expectations.  These lingering challenges aren’t stopping the major manufacturers from continuing their development efforts with billions of dollars being spent on technology, research, and development. The critical technologies include: </p>

      <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) – </strong>compared to a virtual train track, the autonomous-vehicle mapping technology helps the vehicle recognise pedestrian traffic, other vehicles on the road, and the various road signs. One of the most significant technologies behind autonomous driving AI is deep learning, which mimics neuron activity, supports functions like voice and speech recognition, voice search functions, image processing and recognition, motion detection, and analysis of data. </p>

      <p><strong>Safety & security – </strong>As previously mentioned safety and security is the key requirement for the progression of autonomous vehicles, not only for the riding public but also for passengers, pedestrians, and other road users. Intel has developed RSS (Responsibility-Sensitive Safety) which is a framework designed as a way to start conversations about best practices for keeping cars safe.  To ensure consistent safety results, autonomous vehicles are equipped with multiple cameras and other types of sensors to carefully monitor the external environment in which the vehicle is currently operating.  Concerns around hacking of autonomous vehicles is also a key concern for manufactures and users alike. </p>

      <p><strong>Network infrastructure – </strong>Fast and consistent connectivity between autonomous vehicles and external sources (such as cloud infrastructure) ensures signals get to and from vehicles quickly.  As technology advances so will the range of services which will be available in autonomous vehicles.</p>

      <p><strong>Sensor technologies – </strong>Rapidly evolving to meet the demands of the ever-growing autonomous vehicle market, sensor systems such as radar and lidar (laser light radar) allow the vehicle to operate at one of the five previously mentioned autonomous (SAE) levels.</p>

      <br>

    <h2> What is the likely impact? </h2>

      <p> As <i> Yeruva (2022)</i> explains, when Henry Ford had the very first assembly line in in the last century it transformed the way we lived, the potential impact on how we live, and work as autonomous vehicles become more advanced has the potential to be just as transformative.   The global investment in autonomous vehicle technology is over $200 billion and growing.  Whilst the majority of people think of Tesla personal automobiles, there is significant investment being made into developing commercial autonomous fleets. These fleets are expected to filter into the logistics industry which will then cascade change into the retail and commerce industries. In addition, autonomous vehicles have really taken off in the mining industry. </p>

      <p><i>Cholteeva (2021) </i> explains that not only is Fortescue Metals one of the early adopters of a large-scale rollout of an autonomous mining fleet of 183 haul trucks, but it has recently retrofitted an autonomous solution to four Ford Ranger light vehicles, which has removed the need for mechanical fitters to make roughly 12,000 28-kilometre round trips annually.  This has eliminated the need for fitters to manually transport equipment and instead remain focussed on their maintenance responsibilities, in tern increasing productivity, flexibility and a reduction in safety incidents. Vehicle accidents relate to a quarter of the mining fatalities between 2000-2017 and the most frequently contacted secondary vehicle type was a light vehicle.  As covered by the <i>Department of Mines (2016, p. 7)</i> A light vehicle was contacted by a much larger vehicle in 33 of 36 collisions – removing the need to have people driving light vehicles on mine sites removes the risk of personal injury and also greatly reduces the risk of equipment damage due to the technology and rules in place which physically restrict vehicle to vehicle contact. </p>

      <p>Fully autonomous vehicles will make some jobs redundant, such as Taxi Drivers, Truck Drivers, Bus Drivers, Train Drivers, Mine Site Operators, however on the other hand there have been many new jobs created by the implementation of autonomous vehicles – developers of the technology, operators of remote autonomous vehicles, developers of support infrastructure (autonomous GPS and geofencing technology).  Personal experience on mine sites has also taught me that the introduction of autonomous haul trucks has increased costs in unexpected areas, as an example some mine sites have discovered that the loader operators have become much more careless when loading into autonomous dump trucks resulting in regular damage of the dump body which now need to be replaced more frequently than when a loader operator knew that a Haul Truck they were loading had a driver sitting inside.  </p>

      <br>

    <h2>How will this affect you? </h2>

      <p> As discussed by the <i>NRMA (n.d.)</i> the potential impact of high scale introduction of autonomous vehicles on individuals is:  </p>

      <p><strong> 1. </strong>Roads will be safer, with the majority of accidents (94%) being caused by human error,  </p>

      <p><strong> 2. </strong>Reduced emissions, and pollution by reducing transport and energy consumption by up to 90%,  </p>

      <p><strong> 3. </strong>Reduced costs and maintenance requirements – autonomous cars are driven more efficiently, reducing fuel costs, wear and tear on brakes and associated componentry. </p>

      <p><strong> 4. </strong>Reduced congestion – resulting in reduced time taken to travel from point to point, and; </p>

      <p><strong> 5. </strong>Increased mobility options – Elderly, young, and disabled people who may not be able to personally drive or control a vehicle currently will soon be able to utilise a fully autonomous vehicle, increasing independence which has further onflow benefits to society. </p>

    <br>

      <p>  For me personally the introduction of autonomous vehicles will allow me to see my elderly parents more often.  As they have gotten older they now restrict their driving to local roads within their suburb only, having an autonomous vehicle would allow them to travel further within the metro region to see family and friends, reducing their independence on others and potentially improving their personal wellbeing as they get older.   </p>

      <p> In addition, it may improve our ability to recruit employees at our business – currently we find people are reluctant to travel longer distances from one end of the city limits to the other due to traffic congestions, increasing fuel costs, and a lack of well-connected public transport networks.  Having an autonomous vehicle that can take you from point to point would encourage people to travel further distances, without the stress of driving in heavily congested traffic, they can relax whilst travelling to their place of employment, knowing that they will arrive safely with reduced costs. </p>
