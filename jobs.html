<h1> Burning Glass Technologies and Industry data </h1>

<div class="tech1">
<p> To determine the viability of our ideal jobs as outlined within the previous portion of this web page, and with our ideal jobs and skills outlined to the left, we can use industry obtained research data from a range of sources, such as the Australian Government’s National Skills Commission Skills priority list, Deloitte’s Australian Digital Pulse findings and the Burning Glass Technologies Information Technology industry data.Let’s use the information that is provided within these documents and findings and correlate this with our group’s ideal roles. </p>

<p>But first, let’s start with the <strong>Burning Glass Technology (BGT) IT Industry data.</strong> </p>

<h3>What is BGT Data</h3>

<p>The University of Adelaide describes BGT as data obtained and analysed from millions of job listings and resumes via usage of an artificial intelligence application to determine several key findings, such as what skillsets are most sought after by employers and how these skillsets vary between each industry. <i>(University of Adelaide, 2020)</i>. The data obtained via BGT will “identify three different skill types, namely: Baseline Skills, Technical Skills and Software Skills.” <i>(University of Adelaide, 2020)</i>. </p>


<p> After speaking directly with both pharmacists and a local Doctor, I have found that both would appreciate and benefit from such a system. Put simply, the benefit of this application would be to securely have a direct line of communication between doctors, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals to avoid any errors. We hope this app will help with common errors that occur due to today's lack of professional communication. Common errors included: Duplication of therapy (either getting two of the same medication or two drugs in the same class). Omitted but necessary medications. Unreported use of herbals or dietary supplements <i>TheConversation.com (2018)</i>. Common mistakes on prescriptions and issues with transferring of care can take up to 48 hours to resolve using today’s industry standard of communication between professionals. </p>

<p>To quickly summarise what these mean in the scheme of employment opportunity and Information Technology based careers: </p>

<p><strong>1. Baseline Skills:</strong> Outlines skills that are relevant to the job that are not job specific. For example, this tends to focus on skillsets that a potential employee may have such as communication skills, problem solving and organisational skills <i>(BGT, 2019:4)</i> which have context that can be applied to almost any job. </p>

<p><strong>2. Technical Skills:</strong> These are skills that outline desired expertise and understanding required to complete certain technical tasks, such as that of having experience with programming, data analysis and server maintenance. <i>(BGT, 2019:4)</i> </p>

<p><strong>3. Software Skills:</strong> These are skillsets that outline desired experience in various computer software to complete the job effectively, which may include expertise in SQL, Adobe CS and SAP. <i>(BGT, 2019:4)</i> </p>

<p>Within the BGT data, we can see immediately (with each page listed in order, respectively) <i>(BGT, 2018)</i>: </p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> What baseline skills are most sought after by employers, </p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> What specialised skills are most sought after by employers (mix of technical and software skills), </p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> A list of which jobs are considered the top IT titles, </p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> The experience of how many years worked within the industry required to be considered for the role, and;</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> A list of top IT Occupations. </p>

<p>We also have to consider that this list of IT industry data produced by BGT is from 2018, and as such, it’s worth looking at the fastest growing skills required for the industry, as below: Fig. 9 - Burning Data collaborated .pdf file. Fig. 10 - Predicted BGT skillsets 2019-2021. It’s worth noting that within this list there is a skillset prediction based around a rise in autonomous cars and cryptocurrency skills being required from the 2019-2021 period quite intriguing, given this is a portion of our technologies study. </p>

<br>

<p><strong>Comparing the data to our group's ideal jobs: </strong></p>

<p><strong>Ranking job titles with groups ideal jobs: </strong></p>
<p>Between the period of 24/03/2017-23/03/2018, these roles had the highest active selections: </p>

<p><strong>1. CHRISTOPHER MCLEOD:</strong> Digital Designer (Web and Interaction Designer).
  <p>Given the role for Chris’ dream occupation requires such a wide range of skills, such as front-end development and web design for a specific company, which is listed as being with Culture Kings, puts him as being the most sought-after member of The IT Crowd in the eyes of an employer. From the data above, there were 738 Front-end developer roles active and 381 web developer roles in line with what Chris was after. <i>(BGT, 2018)</i> </p>

<p>According to the Australian Government's National Skills Commission, Christopher's role is currently not in shortage/demand in most Australian states except New South Wales but has a strong future demand in all Australian states. (NSC, 2021) </p>

<p><strong>2. ALISTAIR MCLEOD:</strong> Full Stack Web Developer.</p>
<p>Alistair's dream occupation, given this focuses on both the front end and back end of web development, is difficult to place on where this is most sought after in comparison to Brett and Daniel's dream IT Managerial role. However, as there is nil “IT Manager” job title listed within page 3 of the .pdf, I am reflecting on the data within the BGT's top occupations data from page 5, in which it shows in comparison of there being 3,749 IT Manager active selections in comparison to Alistair's web developer role having 5,990 active selections. <i>(BGT, 2018)</i> </p>

<p>Also, like Chris' role, the Australian Government's National Skills Commission presents New South Wales as being the only state with a current shortage for Web Developer’s (Full Stack developers) however has a strong future demand Australia wide. <i>(NSC, 2021)</i> </p>

<p><strong>3. BRETT RUSSELL AND DANIEL SODEMAN:</strong> Manager Information Technology</p>
<p>As both Brett and Daniel have their dream job as being a manager of Information Technology, they’re both being placed within the same bracket of being 3rd most sought after in relation to the BGT Industry Data top job occupations .pdf file. As outlined within this file (page 5) this shows that there were 3,419 IT Manager active selections for the occupation within that year. <i>(BGT, 2018)</i> </p>

<p>In contrary to the industry data, as outlined within the National Skills Commission Skills Priority List report, An ICT Project Manager has a strong current shortage across all Australian states and a strong future demand across Australia. <i>(NSC, 2021)</i>. As such, it’s difficult to place whether Brett and Russell should be at Rank number 1 or shared rank of number 3 within the group, but from the data provided by BGT, I have placed them within this rank as a collective. This is also backed up by information provided by Deliotte’s Digital Pulse Report showing that there is currently just over 50,000 more employed IT technicians and professionals than IT Managers, with there expected to be around 80,000 more technicians than managers within the industry by 2027. <i>(Deloitte, 2022)</i> </p>

<p>Upon consideration of his ideal job and feedback from Assignment 1, Brett has chosen to continue with his quest to become an IT Manager, at this stage in his career and after being in leadership positions for a number of years now he believes he has a lot to offer in the way of ensuring an IT team works together cohesively and in a manner that both achieves its company goals as well as having a level of personal job satisfaction and feeling a part of something bigger. He would still need to upskill himself further to be able to perform the technical aspect for the role. </p>

<p>Fig.11 - Graph taken from Deloitte's Digital Pulse report (Deloitte, 2022:13) outlining the growth of our industry.</p>

<p><strong>JAKE BONE:</strong> Fraud and Cyber Security Analyst</p>
<p>Being the least sought-after role by employers, with there being only 1,716 active selections for IT security analysts within the BGT industry data’s Top Occupations <i>(BGT, 2018)</i> .pdf file, this is more of a niche role to fill. However, this does not detract from the fact that cyber security is incredibly important, especially given the frequency and severity of cyber attacks that occur daily and is a high topic within the news as of the time of writing, October 2022. </p>

<p>And lastly, in comparison to the NSC’s Skills Priority list report, an ICT security specialist is in strong demand within all Australian states and has a strong future demand. (NSC, 2021) </p>

<br>

<p><strong>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers? </strong></p>

<p>Whilst each of our roles are different, our specialist skillsets are among those that are highly sought after by employers. As outlined above, our roles are those which are either in strong demand currently or have been predicted to have a strong demand in the future. Programming skills and platforms, such as SQL, JS and Java, are amongst the three highest skillsets desired by employers within the industry, as shown from within the BGT data. </p>

<p>Not only that, with all of our roles using the Microsoft Windows OS, which ranks in as being number 4 in the 2018 BGT data, and followed shortly after project management and business management at rank 5 and 7 respectively. However, some of our specialist skillsets for Alistair and Chris’ roles involving desired web design and production and Jake’s work requiring Python as a programming language, these rank at a mid to low range in skills in greatest demand according to the BGT data. </p>

<p><strong>How do the general skills in our required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?
</strong></p>

<p>Like our specialist IT skillsets, our group's desired baseline skillsets rank as being in high demand. Communication Skills and Problem-Solving skills are required by all our ideal jobs to be effective at the role, which rank at 1 and 2 respectively within the BGT data. Teamwork Skills rank just beneath this at number 5 and management skills rank at mid-range. This suggests that our group will require mostly all of the baseline skills expected from our employees to be a suitable candidate. </p>

<p><strong>What are the three highest ranked baseline skills and IT-specific skills which are not in our required skill sets?</strong></p>

<p>Our group has a good range of baseline and specialist skills, but in comparison to our ideal job's specifications, we may not require a few other baseline skills which may be expected within other IT related roles. For example, within our baseline skillsets, it's not required of us to have organisational skills, writing skills and troubleshooting skills. These rank in at rank 3, 4 and 6 respectively within the BGT 2018 data, with these being the three highest baseline skills in greatest demand. And likewise, if we were to rank what specialist skillsets are the most desired outside of our listed skills, these would be experience in SAP, Building relationships and Graphic Design. These rank in at rank 5, 7 and 9 respectively. </p>

<p><strong>Review of this data and what it means for The IT Crowd:</strong></p>

<p><strong>ALISTAIR – </strong> This data didn’t really present anything too out of left field for me. I had assumed with the way technology is constantly evolving and how everything is moving online that a career in Web Development would be in constant demand moving into the future. There are currently no shortages in Australia for Web Devs except NSW which works well for me living in Sydney. My overall desire to work towards a career as a Full Stack Developer hasn’t changed since reviewing the data but has probably opened my eyes to the need to be able to set myself apart from others in a very popular career field. I may need to look at constantly updating my skill sets and keep up with trends in the development space to do this. </p>

<p><strong>JAKE – </strong> I found this data extremely valuable and surprising at the same time. To be honest, I knew that my ideal role in fraud and cyber security was a bit niche in comparison to a lot of the other available IT roles out there. In saying that, with my skillsets being in high future demand, and with the amount of cyber security attacks that occur every day, I am feeling like my feelings of my dream job haven't changed, but that I might need to consider the possibility of expanding my knowledge and expertise elsewhere within the industry if I cannot find a suitable role within my dream job's field. For example, I might consider working with and learning from server technicians, programmers and data analysts and build my required skillsets further, such as gaining a knowledge in SQL, Python and R, and may find another role that suits me and my skills better. </p>

<p><strong>CHRIS – </strong> After reviewing this data and comparing it to my ideal job I can see that the industry values the skillset required for this role. Workers moving into this field seem to have been popular as this is a highly ranked job. In the future more workers will be required to fill the projected gap which shows this area is only going to grow. All this shows me my current ideal job will need a worker like myself once I graduate. Also, to stand out by having the skillset required and keeping up to date with the latest technology is key.</p>

<p><strong>DANIEL – </strong> I reviewed the Burning Glass data and can conclude that pursuing the role of an IT Manager is something that is very attainable. There is a current shortage for this position and it is expected in the future that there will be strong demand. There are currently many more technicians/professionals than managers and this gap is expected to increase in the future. I have been working in IT for 10 years and believe that I have developed my communication and teamwork skills to a point where I feel confident in moving into a leadership role in the near future. Skills I am looking to attain include management/project management as well as programming and SQL. These will put me in a positive stead towards achieving the goal of being an IT Manager. </p>

<p><strong>BRETT – </strong> Upon consideration of his ideal job and reviewing the Burning Glass data, as well as feedback from Assignment 1, I have chosen to continue with my quest to become an IT Manager.  At this stage in my career and after being in leadership positions for several years now I believe I have a lot to offer in the way of ensuring an IT team works together cohesively and in a manner that both achieves its company goals as well as staff having a level of personal job satisfaction and feeling a part of something bigger. I would still need to upskill myself further to be able to perform the technical aspect for the role, which I can do via online learning and courses conducted in Perth as per key points in my Assignment 1. </p>
