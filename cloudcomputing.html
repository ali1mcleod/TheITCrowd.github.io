<h1> Cloud Computing - IT Technologies </h1>
<p><strong> Christopher McLeod - s3971045 </strong></p>

<h2> What does it do? </h2>

<p> Cloud computing can be defined as distributing tools, applications, and services through the internet <i>(Investopedia 2022).</i> Common forms of cloud computing today are data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software. A common question that is asked by people trying to access ‘the cloud’ is “where is the cloud?”. </p>
<p> The cloud is distributed across servers and data centres all over the world. This forms a network of computers, hard drives and servers that work together to give you access to a broader range of services, memory, and computing power you normally wouldn’t be able to access whilst working off a local network. Although it is important to note that many different companies own these ‘data farms’ and take part in creating these cloud systems, along with maintaining them and selling the services to customers. </p>
<br>
<p> The main types of cloud computing services include: </p>

 <p>   1. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) Infrastructure refers to the storage, servers and operating systems that are sold on an as need basis. This is referred to as the ground level of the three services. Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud are companies that provide this service. </p>

 <p>   2. Platforms-as-a-Service (PaaS) PaaS is a range of different platforms from different companies. These platforms allow users to create SaaS, or websites that are to be used by the public. This is the middle layer. </p>

 <p>   3. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). The is the most recognisable layer as it deals with pay-as-you-go software that is licensed for a period. Such examples of this software are Adobe’s Creative Suite or Microsoft 360. </p>

 <br>

 <p> What does the future of cloud computing offer that we don’t already have? Many of today’s feature’s offer expert advice from expert staff without having to pay wages. We can design, launch and expand rapidly without the need for building out existing hardware, or paying for electricity of unused data centres. You can safely store your important data off site to protect you from a range of threats. Covid has shown us the need for cloud computing in a modern workspace. We can safely share, collaborate, and connect on work projects together, as well as for teachers to connect with students. The current landscape of modern IT shows that cloud computing is playing a large role in deploying services that keep innovation thriving and pushes the boundaries of what companies can accomplish in a short amount of time.  </p>

<p> An example of one innovation in cloud computing is the promising idea that artificial intelligence (AI) will become a tool in helping to protect cloud environments. “AI can help to identify and block threats that would otherwise go undetected. However, some challenges come with using AI for security purposes.” <i>(SoftwareSecured 2022)</i> Obvious benefits of AI taking on any role is less human interaction and less room for error. Although AI is not perfect, especially when it comes to data that is unstructured, siloed, or incomplete. AI also can pick up on the behaviours of attackers due to its large computing power. Smaller companies will soon be able to access the benefits of AI computing as “using AI based solutions can be far more cost effective than manual testing, which is a big positive for the clients that don’t have big security budgets” <i>(SoftwareSecured 2022).</i> </p>

<p> Another innovation we see taking hold in the industry and companies offering of a hybrid cloud. This is offering a hybrid of pay-as-you-go public cloud solutions as well as a more customized and flexible private cloud solutions. The benefit of this system is that “Data that needs to be quickly and frequently accessed, perhaps by customers, can be kept on public AWS or Azure servers and accessed through tools, applications, and dashboards. More sensitive or mission-critical data can be kept on private servers where access can be monitored, and it can be processed using proprietary applications.” <i>(Forbes 2022)</i> Many companies have found themselves in a hybrid situation spread out over data centres from different companies as no one offered this as a service. It seems moving forward more companies will move all their data over to one company’s services reducing complexity and streamlining the user experience.  </p>

<p> A new product in the cloud computing arena adds another acronym no one asked for. Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS). This trend is bound to make innovation more achievable as companies such as AWS Labmda, AzureFunctions and IBM Cloud Functions adopt this model. Functions-as-a-Service means “organizations aren't tied into leasing servers or paying for fixed amounts of storage or bandwidth. It promises a truly pay-as-you-go service where the infrastructure scales invisibly as an application requires it.”  <i>(Forbes 2022)</i> This service removes another layer of technicality and makes cloud computing more accessible.  </p>

<h2> What is the likely impact? </h2>

<p> Quite a few will benefit from these advancements. developing technologies like AI are driving cloud spending growth. The further in time we go the more companies will be able to take advantage of AI being able to assist them with their security. AI like many other advancements will cost more at the start, as this becomes an industry standard and prices come down due to advancements in development more companies will be able to benefit from this type of tool. Mostly larger companies with a need for AI security will use this technology and if the cost does remain at a higher price point, then as the more customers you have to spread out this cost the cheaper it becomes. I believe AI will be an additional tool in cyber security and will not erase humans all together. Although this is the big question everyone’s asking when it comes to AI. Hybrid pay-as-you-go cloud solutions is “a feature all the big players in the cloud services business are now emphasizing as the future of cloud computing.” <i>(Tech Journal 2022)</i> </p>
<p> Due to lower costs and being able to scale without waste more businesses are expected to jump onto the cloud. The post-pandemic workplace also proves that cloud computing services are essential and the opportunity to grow, rising customer demands and the growing needs of organisations all show the above trends will make the creation of more jobs easier for companies. Some jobs that could be made redundant is technicians that work for companies in managing their networks and computer systems. As more companies move online there is no longer a need for in house technicians, of course not every company needs one, and not every company is 100% on the cloud but we cloud see this is as one of the few declining jobs in the IT sector. This is due to cloud services offering all of the security and handling of hardware off site.  </p>

<h2> How will this affect you? </h2>

<p>I can see this effecting most of the people on the planet is some way. Whether it’s how we buy online, these technologies give way to more companies moving to the cloud and having the option to expand quickly and efficiently. The gives way for more companies striking while the iron is hot and not being bogged down by the costs and other aspects associated with growing an e-commerce store. We can apply this concept to every industry that is yet to have the opportunity of rapid online growth in their sector. I believe with more companies online, more products and services will be available to consumers in the future. When businesses are able to work how they want, whether it’s a hybrid system of cloud computing or pay-as-you-go the costs for that company will come down. This will hopefully lead to companies growing and re-investing or make products and services cheaper. This will affect everyone. AI as a trend might make people trust the cloud more, we might have more data online than we already do, whether it’s a digital passport or digital currency, the more secure and safe the cloud is the more the public will trust it. If we had little to no data breaches online this could change how the world works drastically, and could open up a whole new meaning to ‘digital identity’.  </p>
